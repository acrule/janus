# Janus
Janus is a Jupyter Notebook extension that helps users keep clean notebooks. It
tracks all changes to the notebook and lets users *fold cells* so their
notebooks can provide a summary of their work with details-on-demand. Together
these history and summarization features enable users to keep a short notebook
without losing the full context of their work.
